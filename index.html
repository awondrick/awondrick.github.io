      <h1>Mo's Hava Java</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Sip on this</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There's a lot of funky stuff going on out there in both the physical and the meta-physical world. Lot of people spouting out ideas and shit. Trying to drum things up, start a fire.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This here spacial continuum within the World Wide Web is meant to be a place of refuge. A warm and woolen blanket, all woven in intricate patterns, wrapped around your body as the stars shine overhead. The smoke from a fire is billowing softly from  smoke stacks, as the city lights twinkle in the distance.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You are standing there, wrapped in your blanket, in the dirt median separating two directions of traffic on the I-85. In front of you is a wide canyon, carved out by ancient floods, and across it a bridge that whispers the triumphs of mankind over its environment. </p>
