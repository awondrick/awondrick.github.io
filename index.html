      <h1>Mo's Hava Java</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Welcome, sit down, have yourself a rejuvenating mug of warm, delicious, coffee.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you have by chance stumbled across this anomalous web-page, in the vast noise and clutter of the World Wide Web, then congratulations. Pat yourself on the back. You have made it this far, so some reward for your efforts is in due order. </p>
      <br>
      <p>On this web page, you will be exposed to my mind. It may not please you, that is, what you find extracted and stored in an amalgum all across this simple site. However, it is in my own best interest to attempt to disseminate my thoughts out into empty space. If I kept it all locked up, surely I would suffer greatly and unduly. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Hopefully, you will leave this place a little wiser, a little more open to the world and all the individuals inhabiting it. Hopefully, you will not resent me. Maybe, we could even come to know each other, if you felt so inclined as to reach out across the void and share a simple hello, a how do you do. And if not, that's quite alright.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Please, enjoy your stay...</p>
